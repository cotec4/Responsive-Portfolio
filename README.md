# Responsive-Portfolio
In my second repository (second homework assignment), I had to create a mobile responsive portfolio from scratch. I started with Bootstrap frameworks (including a navbar, responsive (grid) layout, and responsive images which worked as links to my social media accounts. I also had to create my own CSS style sheet to ensure styling beyond what Bootstrap bases provided.

This was a challenging assignment especially ensuring the grid system functioned properly as well as specific formatting components of the nav-bar.
