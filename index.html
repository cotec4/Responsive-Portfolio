                        <p>Hi! My name is Connor Cote. I have three older siblings, four nephews (soon to be one niece),
                            many many cousins and spend the majority of my time focused on family, friends and work. I
                            am in this class primarily to help my current career in the technology consulting field. I
                            have a business background and want to learn more about web development and coding in
                            particular. Pictured to the left is my older brother (Kevin), myself and my dad. This
                            picture was taken at a football game - crazy to think about attending a large sporting event
                            now! My story really starts in Atlanta where I was born and raised. I attended Saint Jude
                            elementary school before attending Marist School starting in 7th grade. After Marist, I went
                            north to attend Boston College (a school where I felt at home since all three of my
                            siblings, my parents and my in-laws also attended). At Boston College, I majored in Finance
                            and
                            Accounting with a French language minor. I also had the opportunity to spend some time
                            abroad during my
                            junior year spending first semester in Paris, France (I was there in during the 2015
                            bombings and terrorist attack and am happy to discuss it if you are interested). I spent
                            second
                            semester in Hong Kong and traveled throughout Southeast Asia. </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>After graduating from Boston College, I moved to New York City and started my career in
                            Investment Banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. After 4,000+ hours, I realized that
                            banking was not the career path I wanted and switched directions into consulting. Now I work
                            as an <span class="Job">Operations Associate</span> for <span class="Job">Francisco Partners
                                Consulting</span> which is the consulting arm of the private equity comapny, Francisco
                            Partners. My goal for taking this class is to develop the ability to work closely with the
                            product teams at the companies we invest in.</p>
